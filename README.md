# SkotOS-Doc

SkotOS, from ChatTheatre, is a suite of tools for making text-based games. If you want to ***play*** a SkotOS-based game, you can make an account on [Castle Marrach](https://www.marrach.com/), [The Eternal City](https://www.eternalcitygame.com/), [https://allegoryofempires.com/](https://allegoryofempires.com/) and/or [Multiverse; Revelations](https://home.multirev.net/).

But if you want to ***build*** a SkotOS-based game, this is a good place to start.

SkotOS runs primarily in a dynamic game-development language called [DGD](http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/). There are also miscellaneous scripts and tools in other languages, such as the Node.js-based websocket relay.
