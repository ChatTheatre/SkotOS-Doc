### [Container Values](ContainerValues)

Here are some real world capacity and max weight values of some common
containers, and if we estimated them, how we did so.

Container mass and contents mass is in kilograms. Contents volume is in
cubic meters. Of course, both the 'contents mass' and 'contents volume'
are actually maximums ...

Remember to add the 'container mass' to the 'contents mass' to get the
proper Woe-style 'max weight'.

In a very general way, the difference between gross weight (including
the container-objects own weight) and net weight (the weight of the
contents only) is about 10%; if you don't know the actual value, it's a
good rule of thumb.

As for the maximum weight which can be carried, multiply the volume (in
cubic meters) by 2000 for a very crude approximation in kilograms, if
actual values aren't known. I used a multiplier of 1500 for some of the
items above, as it seemed to fit them better (the backpacks and luggage,
mostly). This multiplier would actually be based on the engineering and
materials of the container: a shopping bag made from sheet steel would
be able to carry more than one made from kraft paper.

The volume converter at
[www.allmeasures.com](http://www.allmeasures.com/conversion.asp?volume=on&Submit=Converter)
can also be very useful.

All of the items on the list were referenced to measured examples ... no
guesses involved for the volumes or container weights. "Maximum weight"
of course is a guess for each of them except the ocean cargo container
and the 55 gallon drum. %META:TOPICMOVED{by="ChristopherAllen"
