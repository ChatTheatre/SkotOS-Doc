*The concept of inheriting specific derived properties, features and
aspects from a preset parent source, in a vertical chain-like manner.*

     <b>parent source</b>
             |
             |
         <i>derived</i>
          :  &#92;
          :   &#92;
          :<b>children</b>
          :     |
          :     |
          : <i>derived</i>
          :  /  .
          : /     .
    <b>grand-children</b>  .

The **children** inherits all derived features from the parent source;
the **grand-children** inherits all derived features from all
**parents** (**parent source** and **children**).

**Which properties are inherited?**

\* Most of the base:\* properties. \* All merry scripts. \* All details.
\* Any properties beginning with \"export:\"
