# SkotOS Story Building

Story Builders create in-game objects and systems. In the [heirarchy of SkotOS roles](../Basics/Roles.md), they're far more technical than players, but weild less power than low-level developers. There's a ***lot*** of room within the Story Builder role to create whole new game systems, verbs, and even some amount of the game's "physics."

The systems below are often written by Story Builders, and everything here is at least used by Story Builders. A Developer should know about this world, even Developers who focus more on the lowest levels.

## An Outside-to-Inside Intro

Note: this is going to want rewriting into a unified tutorial, updated for the latest ChatTheatre SkotOS. In the mean time, here are some interesting lessons to get started... which may not all work perfectly any more.

## SAM and MERRY

Most SkotOS in-game building happens in SAM, the markup language of SkotOS, and in MERRY, the scripting language of SkotOS. There are a number of systems built on top of both, and you're likely to build on top of them yourself.

Both, especially MERRY, interact extensively with WOE objects.

## Skotos Builders Twiki (TODO: convert more)

There's lots of interesting stuff still in the TWiki, and some of it's clearly worth converting. Here are some starting points for further conversion:
